It's filled with demons, and eyeballs, and all sort of gross stuff. There are a few other ones, but I won't tell you about it! Go find it. New Items! 50+ items to discover. including weapons, armor, food, books, and silly hats. New Classes! Play as The Sharpshooter, a long range fighter. The Prophet, a healer that can sacrifice health for power. The Tourist, starts with random equipment. Or... The Lunatic, because only a lunatic would play this class. New foes!

Barony 20XX is a total conversion mod for Barony - New books, models, sounds, icons, music, and more! Currently the content goes as far as completely converting everything in the initial release of the game, so hell and the crystal mines haven't been replaced just yet, however a lot of the content that carries over into a new game and early game loot tables has been replaced for consistency, though you will notice some items (like Quivers) from newer patches are missing. These will be implemented eventually! Our goal is to recontextualise the setting of Barony, while taking care to keep the experience as close to vanilla as possible - be it the books, the items, or the nomenclature - we're hoping this mod can be seen as an alternative skin for the base game for those who prefer Cyberpunk to Fantasy rather than a must-have replacement. This has been 2 years in the making, and we at Studio Dreamlance truly hope you enjoy it. Thank you! The Story so Far... Once, there was a great city of glass and steel. For many years this city stood as a monument to industry and commerce, its citizens wanting for nothing. That was, until Wallace Herx took control of the corporations. Ruthless and uncaring, Herx saw value only in the bottom line, Profit, no matter the cost. Conditions for the workers decreased ever more drastically, miring the city in crime, drug abuse, and poverty. With wages decreasing and property prices inflating, those who could not afford the luxury of space in this new metropolis were priced out into the slums. Herx, rich beyond compare, retreated to the summit of his great skyscraper, which towers menacingly over the city. His fortune, however, did not go unnoticed by envious eyes. A hit was put out on Herx by an unknown party, promising their share of the spoils to any who could reach and kill him. But a maddening Herx only fortified his redoubt, hiding away behind layers of the best security money could buy. Nobody has seen him in years. And the city around him fell into decay. Grand towers imposing over the hungry masses below - their wealthy occupants blissfully ignorant of the numbing poverty below. And though many have tried and failed, they say that you too could attain the vast wealth of those above, if only you can reach the top. Features A full recontextualisation of the original Barony story. Through filler text and books, the futuristic setting will be explained to you much as the original story was presented, while keeping themes and the tone accurate to the original Full graphical redesign! Tiles, models, icons, UI, and more! New soundtrack, featuring Synthwave and Industrial tracks New sound effects A brand new bestiary of robotic enemies to best on your way to assassinating Wallace Herx Fully rewritten books Completely rewritten terminology - all text now serves to immerse you in the Cyberpunk world! Almost 1:1 map design with vanilla Barony, only changing floors if they would otherwise ruin immersion Installation Instructions Asset swapping is no longer a requirement - just subscribing should install the mod just fine! Who are Studio Dreamlance? We are an ever-expanding group of volunteer game developers and modders, slowly putting together a multitude of projects in our spare time with the hope we can one day make the dream of a full-time game studio a reality.

This may need a rethink on how 20XX icons are designed. Content from later versions (hell, crystal caverns) still remaining No \"victory\" screen, as it ties in with content that hasn't been added yet A lot of the models were made 2 years ago when I had 0 voxel experience.

Bring Halloween models, textures, sounds and music to Barony. Go trick-or-treating, have a costume party, and encounter scarier settings all without modifying any gameplay or invalidating any achievements. Details: Mix hoods, hats and capes to create fun costume combinations. Take on a number of disguises, including pirates, angels, fairies, clowns and other Halloween classics. A number of weapons have also been replaced to reflect Halloween store mainstays, like the devils' pitchfork, and a selection of slasher-style weapons from scary urban legends. Food has been replaced with Halloween sweet treats. All of the music has also been replaced with haunting tracks sourced from the internet. Combined with retextured dungeon walls, floors, and replaced decor items, no matter where you go in Barony, you'll have a taste of your favorite terrorific holiday. All this and much more! We made lots of things to help you build a costume in the game! It starts as soon as you pick your class and race. Each of the three human skintones now have four face paint options: White Grease Paint Incubus / Succubus Face Paint Ghoul Face Paint Superhero Eyemask Note, some weapons have been changed and the skills they use may be less obvious. They are as follows: Bronze sword is now butcher knife (swords) Bronze axe is now cleaver (axes) Bronze mace is now bat (maces) Iron sword is now iron cutlass (swords) Iron axe is now iron hook (axes) Iron mace is now iron hammer (maces) Iron spear is now pitchfork (polearms) Steel axe is now batwing axe (axes) Steel halberd is now steel scythe (polearm) Again this mod is aesthetic only, so you can use it in multiplayer games and on your achievement hunts with absolutely no disruptions to gameplay. v1.0 Updated world tile textures to include additional hand-painted details Added five additional monster changes Corrected errors on some of the v0.9 voxel and icon art Fixed food quality names in some places Added trailer to the workshop item v0.9 Initial release MUSIC CREDITS The rest of this description contains exclusively music credits. I want to give a big shout out to the artists who put their music up for free on the internet. It just wouldn't feel like a total Halloween conversion without spooky music! As Barony itself has an open-source codebase, we love and appreciate the free music.

I thought the workshop needed some more content. I present to you: The Resident Evil 4 Overhaul - The Super Ultra Mega Early Edition. (But for now we'll call it the Resident Evil 4 Audio Replacer since that's all it does.) >>This mod is *Very early*. Please read the notes at the bottom of the textbox.<< >>What it currently does<< 1. Replaces \"Intermission\" (Music that plays in tileset transitions and the starting map) With RE4's \"Serenity\" (Plays when Leon reaches specific safe spots.) 2. Replaces the Shopkeeper theme (referred to in the game files as Shop.ogg) with the Save Theme/Typewriter theme. 3. Adds unique music that plays when the player enters the Gnomish Mines. Track: RE4 OST \"Infiltration\" (Which I believe plays when Leon fights the cultist in red that eventually mounts a gatling gun.) 4. Replaces the death sound with the one from RE4. 5. Mixes the normal buzzer sound that plays when the player attempts to buy an item that they cannot afford with \"Not enough cash, stranger.\" 6. Replaces the sound that plays whenever the player buys/sells an item with \"Heheheh.. Thank you.\" >>Planned Features<< Changing the races to look like RE4 characters with the help of VoxelShop. One of the races (referred to as FemaleFaceMed4 in the game files) already looks really similar to Ada Wong's face so as long as i get the hang of making changing the skin color/adding color variants to prevent it from all being one color we'll be golden. Changing all the gems to look like the Spinel, Velvet blue (might have to make the model slightly larger in order to match the amount of detail), Ruby, and so on. Changing the item pickup noise to match the ones from RE4. Barony has separate sounds that play for gold pickups - which is great because RE4 also has a gold (or PTAS) pickup sound which i think will fit without feeling too out of place. Make some sort of makeshift RE4 Merchant model using the hood model that is already in the game. >>Considered Features/Joke Features<< Complete Music/Ambience overhaul Change the Gnome sounds to the Cultist's chanting sounds. I feel like this'll fit rather nice with the stressful setting. Changing the Succubus' sounds to match Ashley's voicelines (because the Succubus wasn't loud and annoying enough already. Let's make it even worse. lol.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I don't own the PC version of RE4 (i play on an emulator) so i don't have access to all of the files yet. I'll probably buy it soon if i get the money. As of right now, I'm somewhat experienced in image editing and video editing. (and i'm able to do some pretty basic stuff to the audio) Now, video editing is kind of irrelevant to this project but i guess some sort of trailer/update video wouldn't hurt. If anyone is experienced in voxel modelling/pixel art, I want to encourage you to leave suggestions or if you're interested in participating in the project shoot me a message and we'll talk. >>>>Feedback and suggestions are more than welcome!!<<<< >>Version 0.2 notes!!<< Added a video to demonstrate the changes so that you don't have to spend time doing that yourself. The sounds/music is a bit louder and should now blend in a lot better with Barony's loud-ass sounds ; ) I got myself an audio editing software! All of the silence previously present in sounds/music should now be fixed.", "time_created": 1538523414, "time_updated": 1538686493, "views": 6144, "favorited": 45, "tags": ["audio", "v3.2.2"], "votes": {"up": 34, "down": 0}}, {"id": "1667948479", "title": "Actually Scary Minotaur", "file_size": 23820, "preview_url": "", "description": "Makes the minotaur look like they've actually been smashing people into paste their whole life.

So while Daggerfall's dungeons usually featured more ambient tracks, I selected songs that were more memorable for fans of Bethesda's game. These two games share common creatures and mechanics, and I've done my best to select sounds as overt references.

Their words: I was inspired to start this mod after Barony was made open source. In that spirit, all assets used in this pack are GPL compatible, all source textures originated from opengameart.org and credits are included with the mod. The initial scope is to replace all environmental tiles, followed by items and interface elements. Eventually I may replace the 3d models, though that will take much longer and may require updating the game engine. Progress with current release: 80/155 tile images 0/75 sprite images 0/113 item images 0/51 system images This release is an initial proof of concept which alters 80/150 tile textures, changing them to 1024x1024px high res from 32x32px. Source textures are courtesy of opengameart.org and dozens of new textures were created for this mod. As this is a proof of concept, there are some slight tiling errors on some textures, and the rarer textures sometimes look out of place with each other. To install, simply copy the included directories into your barony directory, overwriting files when prompted. It is recommended that you create a backup of your barony directory prior to installing this mod.

Welcome to Demeine, a Barony content modification that replaces all the (original) levels and the entire soundtrack. 1.1 was the bare minimum necessary to get this mod working with the Steam Workshop, therefore there was very little in terms of new content compared to 1.0. My reasoning for uploading this so incredibly late on to the Workshop is the fact that I was originally creating a huge fleshed out update, called \"2.0\", that I had planned to upload instead when it was ready. (Original ModDB page: https://www.moddb.com/mods/demeine ) I lost interest in modding a long time ago but regained it recently, so I decided to finally make the transition with what I had to the steam workshop. With the 1.2 update, I overhauled some levels and polished others to the best of my ability. That being said, I theoretically could have done much more, but I want to save my creative energy for another mod I'm working on. As for Demeine 2.0, I am not sure where to go with it. I have a lot of ideas and work I've put in to it, but I decided recently that I want to do a different type of total conversion. I am reusing some ideas and material from Demeine 2.0 for it, so either 2.0 will basically be absorbed in to this new project, or it will become its own mod in the far future depending on how this new mod turns out, and if I still have enough creative energy by then.", "time_created": 1596794946, "time_updated": 1597495733, "views": 960, "favorited": 10, "tags": ["dungeons", "audio", "textures", "gameplay", "v3.3.6"], "votes": {"up": 7, "down": 0}}, {"id": "1620756320", "title": "You've Been Gnomed (Distorted)", "file_size": 717883, "preview_url": "https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/951849335347116446/DBE098EC2CA9B9F3FBF277EF3CC198BCAB3BC9F8/", "description": "yOu cAn gEt gNoMeD. iTs tHaT sImPlE :0 Thanks to chazoshtare for the idea Changes made: Language file, Gnome sounds.", "time_created": 1547154381, "time_updated": 1547154381, "views": 1536, "favorited": 14, "tags": ["audio", "misc", "v3.2.2"], "votes": {"up": 12, "down": 4}}, {"id": "1489261328", "title": "L4D tank  - Minotaur soundtrack", "file_size": 5448461, "preview_url": "https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/968724911470490105/F083A7DD8767B76A955DAD4EB5825A6B2148AE42/", "description": "This will change the music when the Minotaur spawns to the L4D spawning theme :^) The mod will increase the heroi.. uh..

Please play with friends and offer feedback! A battle map for 4 Players / Teams (4 players on each team with the experimental 16 player branch). Objective: Prevent anyone else from getting your orb! Collect all four orbs, one from each fortress, and use them to activate the tower at center of the battlefield. Take yours on the run and rely on your strength to protect it, or set up ambushes and traps inside your fortress, daring foes to come to you! The team to activate all four orbs is the winner. A portal opens allowing them to start the battle again. Rules: Friendly Fire needs to be on Inventory needs to drop on death Every player should turn off Player Name Tags Battle Classes: To make more viable PVP strategies, the map requires the player to pick a battle class at the start of each round by entering that class' cell. The player then takes on the role of that class, including new stats, gear and skills. This means that when you pick a class before entering the game, that choice will not matter in the ensuing battle. Only the class you select at the beginning of each round will matter. The four classes are: The Knight Boasting excellent close-range combat gear, the knight is not somebody you want to be caught in a fight with toe-to-toe. However, the knight may have a hard time catching foes who simply take his orb and run! You would be wise not to duel with a knight, and a good knight will force you to have no other option. The Assassin An excellent sharpshooter and trapper, the assassin has speed, stealth and special ammo to take down opponents with precision. They also wield a skeleton key and traps, making the fortresses a place where they can wreak special havoc, slowing, disabling, and slaying intruders and inhabitants alike. However the Assassin has little in the way of defenses, both magical and physical, so striking first is essential to survival. The Magician With a lightning staff and scrolls of recharging, the magician is a deadly weapon of war. With the flutter spell, the magician can traverse pits and water that may slow down others, allowing them to easily solve what might be problems for other classes. While the magician's skills are direct, they are also simple and can be countered. A magician who leaves themselves vulnerable to any other class will not survive long. The Chaplain The chaplain may not seem like much at first. With moderate skill with weapons and magic, and little in the way of offensive ability, chaplains don't have a lot of comparative advantages. However, a careful selection of equipment, spells and potions allow the chaplain to disable, befuddle and evade high-power foes, whether physical or magical. A novice chaplain may die quickly on the battlefield if they attempt to compare apples to apples, but a resourceful one will out-wit and out-maneuver their competition, leaving them feeling like they had no way to fight back. Note: Because your class is cleared at the start of the match, your hotbar will be empty. To make setting up your hotbar quicker, consider using the \"Numpad to Hotbar\" setting in the Misc. settings tab, allowing you to quickly assign items by hovering with your mouse, and pressing the key you want it assigned to. Races DLC races can be used with this game mode, but racial spells will be overridden in favor of distinct battle class abilities. As a result, races will keep behavior such as their reactions to curses and blessings, as well as weapon type, magic and environmental resistances or vulnerabilities. In many cases, Human is the best race to choose for this game mode, but other variation brought by the monster races is welcome and considered a viable part of the game mode, even if they lack their native spells. The Map Fortresses There are four fortresses: The Mines Fortress which holds the Green Orb The Labyrinth Fortress which holds the Red Orb The Ruins Fortress which holds the Blue Orb The Hell Fortress which holds the Purple Orb Each fortress is identical in layout, though mirrored according to the corner of the map they are in. Each fortress also holds a variety of chests. Every player will have 30 seconds to pick their class and prepare for battle before the fortress gates open, letting the team come out, and allowing intruders to come in. As you play, note how you might slow an enemy's advance through your fortress, and require them to take risky paths where you could spring traps upon them. Chests and Random Items There are many chests distributed throughout the map and their exact contents are randomized. However, you will be able to find certain kinds of items within the chests consistently, including potions, hardware, equipment, and magic items. Sometimes these chests will be locked. This is an intended advantage for the assassin class. All classes should also pay close attention to their skills, as chests may contain all kinds of things they can benefit from using their expertise. For example, the Assassin is an exceptional Tinker, and the Chaplain is a great Alchemist. Orb Colors The map has four fortresses, each containing a colorful orb. Between them is an island, where each orb must be placed to finish the match. The correct orb must be placed at each pedestal, pointing to its corresponding fortress. The edge of that fortress' corner has a decorative imitation of the orb embedded into its walls. Use this as an indicator to see both where you will obtain the orbs, and what pedestal the orb should go into when you have obtained it. Note: Whenever a player removes or places an orb, the action is permanent and an announcement is made to every player. Use this information to keep track of how the battle is going. Update v0.9 Attached a poison effect to players whose orb has been removed from their fortress. Added a 10 minute timer which spawns tower guardians to hurry the game toward completion. Added a timer warning in two minute increments leading up to 10 minutes. Added bridges to the central tower island, and enlarged the island slightly. Removed summon scroll and spellbot items from the Magician class. Added Teleport Other and Potions of IceStorm to the Magician class. Increased Magician health to 75 to match the Assassin. Reduced Knight AC by reducing the blessings on their armor. Reduced the Knight's Speed Potion count to 1. Increased the Chaplain's damage by increasing the blessing on their mace.", "time_created": 1625512525, "time_updated": 1627021355, "views": 542, "favorited": 13, "tags": ["dungeons", "gameplay", "misc", "v3.3.7"], "votes": {"up": 6, "down": 0}}, {"id": "2390335304", "title": "Bender the Booze-Fueled Robot", "file_size": 216000, "preview_url": "https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1771573592459914120/159EE20462EC939FD11AD6F67AF18EE6B6EC6224/", "description": "This mod replaces the Goatman player race with models and sound effects based on Bender Bending Rodriguez from Futurama.

Nevermind, \"Don't Give Up\" seems to sometimes play, too. \u2022 I tried to stick with songs from the original soundtrack (or at least songs composed by Toby Fox himself: see here ); currently, there is only one exception. I'll probably have to dip into remixes for future levels beyond the classic ones. \u2022 Megalovania is not a track that's used. Not yet, at least. You know damn well why. \u2022 I'm fully aware that name-wise, it would have made more sense to switch the tracks used in the first levels (Mines) with the last levels (Ruins), but eh.

Simply break the back wall on the Mines side treasure room. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Known Quirks ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - The entrance/exit portals/rooms are a little rushed, simply thrown together to facilitate an entrance and ending/exit to the map. I may move the entrance to mines level 4, in order to not block access to the underworld. - It's possible the rewards are either too little or too much.

Whoops! Now it really looks like a beta. - Incubi spawn from the fountains as a result of placement in the level list. They're a bit too much for a character to handle after Mines no matter how strong. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Lore that borders on an excuse plot: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Long before the Baron was sealed, a fountain full of an \"eternal\" amount of elixirs was found.
